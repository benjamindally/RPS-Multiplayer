# Train Schedule

Keep track of all the trains you use with this free, easy web app. Simply add the train you use to the list and the app will save that data for you. The app will remember the name of the train, where it's going, how often it will arrive, and when the next train will arrive. It will even tell you how many minutes until the next train so you can properly prepare!
